# Grafana Screenshot Reporter 

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This project enables users to capture screenshots of their Grafana dashboard automatically and save them to their local machine or send them to an SMTP Gateway as EMail. The project is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, with options to specify the resolution and file name for each screenshot.

The script utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Grafana dashboard, navigate through the pages and take screenshots. Users can specify the URL of the Grafana dashboard they wish to capture, the path where the screenshots should be saved, and the desired resolution of the screenshots.
